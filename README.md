<h2 align="center">Repository: Eyes Movement Exercise</h2>

### Project Title: Eyes Movement Exercise

### Description of Project 
##### This is a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement. When you move the mouse, the mouse events are being picked up and we're moving the eyeball to match the mouse. The mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page.

### How to run this project.
##### You can fork this repo to your GitHub account. You can copy and download the repo to your PC by clicking on the green code button and selecting Download ZIP or you can run the project from the landing or project page.

### Roadmap of future improvements: 
##### I would like to add the option to chose the color of the eyes, background color and face.
